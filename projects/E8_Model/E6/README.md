# E6

E6 is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups, which are fundamental in the study of symmetry in mathematics. It has a complex structure and is associated with a 78-dimensional Lie algebra. E6 is significant in theoretical physics, particularly in grand unified theories and string theory, due to its complex representations and connections to higher-dimensional spaces.
