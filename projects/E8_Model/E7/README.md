# E7

This directory is dedicated to the E7 group, which is part of the E series data generators. It will contain resources and code specific to the E7 group.

The E7 group is one of the five exceptional Lie groups, which are distinguished by their unique properties and structures. E7 is a complex, simply connected, simple Lie group of rank 7 and dimension 133. It is related to the E8 group and plays a significant role in various areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, including string theory and M-theory.

In theoretical physics, the E7 group and its algebra are used to describe symmetries in certain models, particularly in the context of supergravity and string theory. The group's structure and representations are important in understanding the mathematical foundations of these theories.

This directory will contain resources and code specific to the E7 group, focusing on data generators and other relevant materials for exploring the properties and applications of E7 in the context of the E8 model.
