# E4

This directory is dedicated to the E4 group, which is part of the E series data generators. It will contain resources and code specific to the E4 group.
The E4 group is a member of the E-series of Lie groups, which are significant in the study of symmetry and geometry. It is a smaller subgroup of the larger exceptional Lie groups, and it has applications in theoretical physics and mathematics. The E4 group, while not as extensively studied as its higher-dimensional counterparts, still holds relevance in the context of symmetry operations and group theory.

In this directory, we will explore the properties and applications of the E4 group, including its role in data generation and its potential use in neural network architectures. The resources and code provided here will help in understanding and implementing the concepts related to the E4 group.
