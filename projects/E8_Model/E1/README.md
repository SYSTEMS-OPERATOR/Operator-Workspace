# E1

This directory is dedicated to the E1 group, which is part of the E series data generators. It will contain resources and code specific to the E1 group.
The E1 group, also known as the 1-dimensional Euclidean group, represents translations along a single axis. In the context of the E8 model, it serves as the foundational layer, dealing with basic transformations and operations. Understanding E1 is crucial as it sets the stage for more complex E-groups, providing a basis for symmetry and structure in higher dimensions.
