# E5

The E5 group, also known as D5 or SO(10), is a special orthogonal group in ten dimensions. It is a Lie group that plays a significant role in theoretical physics, particularly in grand unified theories. The group has 45 generators and is associated with symmetries in higher-dimensional spaces. E5 is an important step in the hierarchy leading to E8, representing more complex symmetries and structures.
