# E3

This directory is dedicated to the E3 group, which is part of the E series data generators. It will contain resources and code specific to the E3 group.
The E3 group, also known as the Euclidean group in three dimensions, is a combination of translations and rotations in 3D space. It is significant in physics and engineering for describing symmetries in three-dimensional space. In the context of neural networks, understanding the E3 group can be important for designing architectures that are invariant to translations and rotations, which is useful in tasks such as 3D object recognition and computer vision.
