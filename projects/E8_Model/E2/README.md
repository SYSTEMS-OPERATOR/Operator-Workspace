# E2

This directory is dedicated to the E2 group, which is part of the E series data generators. It will contain resources and code specific to the E2 group.
The E2 group is a mathematical structure that is part of the E-series, representing symmetries in theoretical physics and mathematics. It is fundamental in understanding the hierarchy of embeddings and transformations within the E-series data generators.
