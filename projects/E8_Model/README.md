# E8 Model

This directory is dedicated to the E8 model, a neural network architecture based on M-Theory and matrix theory. It will contain resources and code related to the E series data generators, with a focus on creating a 248-dimensional matrix in PyTorch, using TensorFlow, Keras, and other tools.

## Overview

The E8 Model project is an exploration of neural network architectures based on M-Theory and matrix theory. The primary goal is to develop a 248-dimensional matrix using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras, with a focus on E series data generators. The project aims to leverage the Lie Algebra group to populate predefined matrices between layers of adaptive embeddings, drawing inspiration from m-branes in M-Theory.
Beyond the classical E1–E8 range, this project also provides conceptual resources for E9–E11, allowing experimentation with affine and hyperbolic symmetries relevant to M-theory.


## Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each representing a different E group (E1-E11). These directories contain resources and code related to data generators, neural network implementations, and other relevant components.

- **E1**: Time-based embeddings
- **E2**: Spatial embeddings
- **E3**: Momentum embeddings
- **E4**: Energy embeddings
- **E5**: Charge embeddings
- **E6**: Quantum interference embeddings
- **E7**: Emergence embeddings
- **E8**: Closed system embeddings
- **E9**: Affine extensions
- **E10**: Hyperbolic symmetries
- **E11**: Conjectured M-theory unification
