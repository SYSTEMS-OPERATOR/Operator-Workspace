# E9

The E9 group extends the exceptional series beyond E8. In theoretical physics, it is related to affine Lie algebras and appears in certain formulations of M-theory. While less studied than E8, E9 provides insight into infinite-dimensional symmetries that could underlie string and membrane dynamics.
