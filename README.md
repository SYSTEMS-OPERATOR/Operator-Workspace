# Operator-Workspace

This repository serves as a workspace for organizing and managing tasks. It includes directories for documentation, project files, and other resources. Feel free to add or modify content as needed.

## Requirements

The E-series micro-kernel under `e4d/` relies on NumPy. SciPy is optional and, if
installed, will be used for matrix exponentials and logarithms. Install both
packages via:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy  # SciPy may be omitted for a lightweight setup
```

## Repository Structure

- **projects/**: Contains sub-projects and experiments developed under Operator-Workspace.
  - **E8_Model/**: A project dedicated to implementing E-group concepts (E1â€“E11) within advanced neural architectures.
    - **README.md**: Provides an overview of the E8 Model project, setup instructions, references, and documentation.
    - **E1/** through **E11/**: Each directory contains specific data generation scripts and placeholder modules for each E-layer.

- **docs/**: Stores supplementary documentation, design diagrams, or tutorial notebooks, including an overview of E-groups and matrix theory.
- **scripts/**: Contains standalone scripts for tasks such as data processing, running experiments, or helper utilities.
- **tests/**: Holds unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.

## Usage

To get started with the projects in this repository, navigate to the desired directory and follow the instructions provided in the respective README files. The E8 Model project, for example, contains detailed information on how to set up and run experiments related to E-group symmetries in neural networks.
- You can quickly generate sample datasets for all E groups by running `scripts/generate_all_data.py`.
- The helper `scripts/qa_pipeline.py` scans the repository, detects duplicate files, and consolidates BibTeX references into `docs/refs/e_series.bib`.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding new projects, improving existing ones, or enhancing documentation. Please ensure that any additions adhere to the repository's structure and guidelines.
