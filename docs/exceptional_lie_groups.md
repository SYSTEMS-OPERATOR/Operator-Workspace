# Exceptional Lie Groups E1–E11

This document summarises the main properties of the **E-series** of Lie groups
and outlines their roles in string theory and matrix theory.  The finite groups
E6–E8 are truly exceptional, while E1–E5 are classical groups that complete the
hidden-symmetry chain observed in supergravity.  The higher groups E9–E11 are
Kac–Moody extensions conjectured to capture even deeper symmetries of M‑theory.

## Quick Reference (E1–E8)

| Group | Equivalent algebra | Rank | Dimension | # roots |
|-------|--------------------|-----:|----------:|-------:|
| **E1** | $\mathbb{R}^+$ (scale) | 1 | 1 | — |
| **E2** | $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| **E3** | $\mathfrak{sl}(3)\oplus\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ | 3 | 11 | 8 |
| **E4** | $\mathfrak{sl}(5)$ | 4 | 24 | 20 |
| **E5** | $\mathfrak{so}(10)$ | 5 | 45 | 40 |
| **E6** | $e_6$ | 6 | 78 | 72 |
| **E7** | $e_7$ | 7 | 133 | 126 |
| **E8** | $e_8$ | 8 | 248 | 240 |

E6, E7 and E8 are the genuine exceptional algebras.  E4 and E5 are classical
groups that nevertheless fit naturally in the compactification chain.  Standard

- D. H. Collingwood and W. M. McGovern, *Nilpotent Orbits in Semisimple Lie Algebras*.

### Dynkin Diagrams

E6, E7 and E8 share a forked shape:
```
E6: o–o–o–o–o
          |
          o

E7: o–o–o–o–o–o
             |
             o

E8: o–o–o–o–o–o–o
              |
              o
```
The diagram for E9 adds a looped node to that of E8. E10 and E11 add further nodes in a line.

## Infinite Extensions E9–E11

- **E9** is the affine extension $\widehat{E}_8$.
- **E10** is hyperbolic, often denoted $e_{10}$.
- **E11** is the very extended algebra conjectured to unify M-theory symmetries.

For these, see P. West, *Introduction to Strings and Branes* (chapters on Kac–Moody symmetries) and T. Damour, M. Henneaux, and H. Nicolai, "E10 and a small tension expansion of M theory", [hep-th/0212256](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0212256).

## Roles in Physics

1. **U-duality**: In dimensional reductions of eleven-dimensional supergravity on a torus $T^d$, the scalars typically organize into cosets $E_{11-d}/K(E_{11-d})$. This unifies S- and T-dualities.
2. **Heterotic strings**: The gauge group $E_8 \times E_8$ appears for anomaly cancellation and has inspired model building.
3. **Matrix theory**: The exceptional groups motivate fixed-size matrix blocks used to simulate M-branes.
4. **Symmetry enhancement**: On special loci in F-theory or at singularities, gauge symmetry can enhance to E6, E7, or E8.

## Matrix Representations

Each finite E-group can be realised by matrices in its adjoint or fundamental
representation.  For instance:

* **E4** and **E5** use the classical matrix groups $\mathrm{SL}(5)$ and
  $\mathrm{SO}(10)$.
* **E6** admits a $27\times27$ fundamental representation closely related to the
  Jordan algebra $J_3^{\mathbb{O}}$.
* **E7** acts naturally on a $56$-dimensional symplectic vector space, while
  **E8** has a $248$-dimensional adjoint representation.

Symbolic packages such as **SageMath** or **SymPy** can generate the Cartan
matrix and explicit representation matrices.  These tools are helpful for
verifying ranks, root counts and the structure constants used in this project.

## Computational Tools

- **SageMath**: create root systems via `RootSystem(['E',8])` and list all roots.
- **LiE** or **LieART**: compute branching rules and characters.
- **SymPy**: access Cartan matrices quickly in Python.
