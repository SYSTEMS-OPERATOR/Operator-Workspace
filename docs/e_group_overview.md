# E-Groups Overview

This document summarizes the eight finite E-groups used throughout the project.
Each group corresponds to a specific data generator and embedding dimension.

| Group | Description | Dimensionality |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **E1** | Time-based embeddings | 1 |
| **E2** | Spatial embeddings | 2 |
| **E3** | Momentum embeddings | 3 |
| **E4** | Energy embeddings | 4 |
| **E5** | Charge embeddings | 5 |
| **E6** | Quantum interference embeddings | 6 |
| **E7** | Emergence embeddings | 7 |
| **E8** | Closed system embeddings | 8 |

The data generators for each group create random datasets with the specified
number of features. These datasets are used in simulations to verify that
transformations across the E-series preserve the expected dimensional structure.
