# Higher E-Groups in M-Theory

Beyond the finite exceptional groups, theorists often discuss
E9, E10 and E11. These are infinite-dimensional Kac--Moody extensions
that arise when exploring symmetries of supergravity and string theory.

- **E9** (affine extension) appears in two-dimensional reductions of
  supergravity. It extends E8 by adding a loop algebra direction.
- **E10** is a hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra conjectured to control the
  chaotic mixmaster dynamics near cosmological singularities.
- **E11** has been proposed as a unifying symmetry of M-theory,
  although its physical realization remains speculative.

These higher groups have no finite matrix representations but inspire
hierarchical structures used in the project. The placeholder data
generators for E9--E11 provide simple numerical experiments for
future exploration.
