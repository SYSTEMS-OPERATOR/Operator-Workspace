# E-Groups and Matrix Theory

This guide summarizes the E-series groups used throughout the repository and provides context for their role in matrix theory and M-theory.

## E1–E8

The lower E-groups represent finite-dimensional Lie groups that are well understood mathematically. Each group corresponds to a specific type of symmetry or transformation:

- **E1** – Translations in one dimension.
- **E2** – Planar Euclidean symmetries.
- **E3** – Euclidean group in three dimensions.
- **E4** – An intermediate member of the exceptional series.
- **E5** – Also known as D5 or SO(10), important in grand unified theories.
- **E6** – An exceptional Lie group with a 78-dimensional algebra.
- **E7** – Related to supergravity models.
- **E8** – The largest exceptional group with 248 dimensions.

These groups appear in the data generators and are used to structure embeddings in the project.

## Matrix Theory

Matrix theory describes dynamics of multiple D0-branes and provides a nonperturbative formulation of M-theory. The E-series groups inspire the dimensional layering of matrices and help preserve symmetry across transformations.

## Higher Groups: E9–E11

The groups E9, E10, and E11 are infinite or indefinite extensions of the exceptional series. They arise in studies of affine and hyperbolic Kac–Moody algebras and are conjectured to play roles in advanced M-theory frameworks. In this repository they serve as conceptual placeholders for future tools that may explore these symmetries.
