# Matrix Theory Primer

Matrix theory (often called the BFSS matrix model) provides a non-perturbative
formulation of M-theory. In this framework, D0-branes are described by matrices
whose dynamics capture eleven-dimensional supergravity at low energies.

Key ideas:

- **Supersymmetry** is preserved by representing branes through supermatrices.
- The large-$N$ limit of these matrices is conjectured to reproduce the full
  M-theory in a light-cone frame.
- In the context of the E-series, matrix theory motivates representing each
  group with fixed-dimensional matrices that evolve through "m-brain" modules.
